# Simple-Encoded-Calculater
Python Module

This is a python module in which you can type in a one step math equation like this:

"5+2"

and the output will be in this case, 7, but it might not be if you type in something different.

# Setup

Put the file, **moderncalculater.py** into the same directory in which your python file is in, and then in your python file type the following:

>from moderncalculater import Calculater
>
>c = Calculater()

Then you are free to calculate all you want!

>answer = c.calculate(your_one step problem)
